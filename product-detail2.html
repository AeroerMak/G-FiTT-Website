                        <P>G-Fitt Cleanze the concepts of internal cleansing and detoxification have been around for centuries. One of the keys of anti-aging is to identify useful ways to detoxify our exposure to toxic surrounding elements including our air, water and food. Why we need to do that ? The reason is simple - the more toxins you ingest, the faster you age</P>

                        <p><strong>ISOMALTOOLIGOSACCHARIDES (OLIGO)</strong></p>

                        <p>Oligo is the sugar that is primarily found in fruits. In Japan, it is used in more that 450 types of food. It is assimilated into the body more slowly that white sugar but Oligo has essentially the same nutritional value and is more desirable that sugar. It breaks down more slowly because it does not use insulin but is broken down by an exzyme in the bowel. It is a safer sugar to use and helps to lower the risks of getting diabetes and high cholesterol.</p>

                        <P><strong>APPLE FIBRE</strong></P>
                        <P>Apple is a rich source of dietary fibre and contains vitamin A, B , C and more that 10 types of other nutrients. 
                        Apples are rich sources of phytochemicals ( compounds found in plants, fruits and vegetables that can act as anti-oxidants). 
                        The high fibre content helps in slow release of sugars into the body, thereby helps to maintain a steady blood sugar level. 
                        Apple helps to reduce blood cholesterol, improve bowel function, reduce risk of stroke, prostate cancer, Type II diabetics and asthma. 
                        Apples can also inhibit ageing-related problems, preventing wrinkles and promote weight loss.
                        </P>

                        <P><strong>OAT FIBRE</strong></P>

                        <P>Help to reduce cholesterol, prevent heart disease and high blood pressure. Oat Fibre is rich in Group B viamins and trace minerals. It helps to eliminate piles, alleviate constipation and delay the aging process for maintaining a soft and smooth skin.
                        </P>

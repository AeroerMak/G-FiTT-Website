                        <p>G Fitt Slim coffee is a dieting drink that each sachet contains high quality instant coffee and 200mg Svetol, an extract from green Robusta coffee beans. Svetol contain the same natural ingredients found in the roasted coffee bean, but in much higher concentration.
                            It takes about 10kgs of raw green coffee bean to make 1kg of Svetol using a patented extraction process that also removes the caffeine from Svetol.</p>

This has been the subject of many scientific tests. Svetol also contain another coffee derived substance, caffeic acid, which is a powerful anti-oxidant.
                             Some studies on caffeic acid suggest it may also have anti-carcinogenic properties and so may help prevent cancer.</P>

                              <P>The body is able to make non-essential amino acids from other amino acids in the body. 
                                However, the body is not able to make essential amino acids and the only way to get them is by eating high quality protein foods. 
                                Protein sources that contain all of the essential amino acids are called complete proteins.</P>
